// daemon keeps fresh (lib/tabline.js) — Herdr used to boot a whole node here
// every interval, which cost more CPU than everything the line ever showed.
// Herdr takes the last line of output; a dead daemon leaves a stale line, and
// a missing file makes the command fail, which hides the segment entirely.
//
// Six seconds, not two. A path that costs a process on Windows should not be

// which directory you are in — and the cost is paid on every tick whether or
// not anything changed, since there is no way to ask Herdr to re-run this on
// focus. Herdr's tab bar has no file source: `TabBarRightEntryConfig` is
// Zoom / Hostname / Time / Text / Command, so a command is the only way in.

// cannot drift apart from it again.

// 2s against a 3s timeout, so a command that ran long was still running when the
// next one started. On Windows every one of these is a fresh `cmd.exe` — Herdr's
// own config says so — and the overlap feeds itself: more overlap, slower
// machine, more timeouts, more overlap. It ended at 12.5 cores of Herdr, 35
